## IPL Data Analysis & 2025 Winner Prediction
### Hackathon Submission - Problem Statement 1

### Abstract
This project analyzes historical IPL data (2008-2024) to uncover trends, insights, and key performance indicators. Additionally, it includes building a predictive model to forecast the winner of the 2025 IPL season using machine learning techniques, including ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost.

### Project Structure
- `dedsec_brain_dead_2k25.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with data processing, EDA, and model training.

- `data/` - Folder containing datasets (matches.csv, deliveries.csv).

- `models/` - Saved models for future predictions.

### Steps Taken
#### 1. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

- Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

- Extract meaningful features from matches.csv and deliveries.csv.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Team and player performance analysis (win rates, batting/bowling stats).

- Seasonal trends (run rates, Orange & Purple Cap holders).

- Visualizations with Matplotlib & Seaborn.

#### 3. Predictive Model for IPL 2025 Winner

- Used ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and explored neural networks.

- Evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

- Provided a discussion on strengths, limitations, and insights.

#### 4. Tools & Technologies
- Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost

- Clustering: K-Means for player classification

- Notebooks: Google Colab

#### 5. Results
- Comprehensive Analysis Report with insights & methodology

- Source Code for EDA and IPL winner prediction

- Discussion on Model Performance and prediction results
